# Hello to my future family

In the twilight of 2023, I decided to create a development diary. If any of my family members ever find their way to this page, it would bring me immense joy.

Thank you for checking out this project. When you come across this, I wonder how I am spending my days in the present. Although I do not know how the future world has evolved, I sincerely hope that you are all happy.

This homepage is a part of me, filled with memories from my past. No matter what happens, please never forget that family is bound by a powerful bond.

With love,
